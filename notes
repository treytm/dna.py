Name file dna.py 

Two test files dna.txt ecoli.txt 

Reading sequences of nucleotide into program and processing them 

What does the file look like? 

-Pairs of strings 

-name of sequence, (new line), the sequence 

-each sequence will consist of only A, C, G, T, - 

-input can be upper or lower case, but ignore it 

Junk dna can be ignored (-) except for weight calculations 

Loop through sequences 

Counting nucleotides (acgt) 

Compute mass/weight % 

Display codons (3 nucleotides, ACC, ACT, GAT etc.) 

Determine if the nucleotide sequence is a protein 

Need to learn file format, weight of each nucleotide, and how to determine if something is a protein 

What is a protein? Starts with ATG, ends with (TAA, TAG, TGA), has to have a minimum of 5 codons, mass % (A) + mass% (G), >= .3 

Ask user for name of input and name of output file 

Read input file 

Process input file 

Output results 

The nucleotide output should be in ACGT order 

Output mass % with one decimal point
